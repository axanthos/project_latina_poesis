1. User profile
=================

The user that we seek is the Linguist, the Latin scientist who isn't comfortable with the new Language Computing technologies

2. What does it do?
=================

It gives the user the opportunity to work, in Orange Textable, with the pieces of antique work he's interested in. By downloading the texts from The Latin Library, a website gathering Latin texts, it gives the user an interface easy-to-use, from where he can chose the author and the piece of work he's interested in. The widget gives it back in html format.

3. Which way does it work?
=================
It searches for every author on the website, and not only those visibles on the welcoming page. For each author, it searches every piece of work and gives them an annotation by author. Even if it's complicated by the state of The Latin Library website, that isn't the most regularly built website, the OWLatinTest.py program found a way to gather every informations it needed. When all this informations are placed in an array, they can be used in the widget. That's the cause why the widget installation will take some time. We even had the problem that the website does have a limit to the number of connections availables in a limited time. So if your widget doesn't work, try reinstalling it: maybe you didn't well connected to the website at first.

4. How does it appears?
=================
The interface is voluntarily easy-to-read. There is the less informations possible. You only have to chose two parameters in two list-Boxes. If the author you chose hasn't more than one page on The Latin Library, the lower parameter won't give you any possibility. Don't worry ;-)

5. Project
=================
This project was built all alone by Julien Andenmatten. It was proposed as a project for one semester in Mr. Aris Xanthos class. The results aren't as well finished as they could but they do open a way for the next step to a completely workable proto-widget.
